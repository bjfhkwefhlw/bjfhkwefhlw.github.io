I wanted to take this opportunity to confess my feelings for you. You are always on my mind, and I can't help but smile whenever I see you.

Life feels so much brighter when you're around, and I find myself longing to spend more time with you. Your laughter and the way you light up a room make my heart skip a beat.

Janine, would you do me the honor of being more than just friends? I can't imagine a future without you in it, and I would be overjoyed if you felt the same way.

Please let me know your thoughts, and I hope this confession doesn't affect our friendship negatively. You mean the world to me.

With all my love,

Kent`);
