    <h1>Saying the unsaid words</h1>
    <p>Dear Janine,</p>
    <p>I wanted to take this opportunity to confess my feelings for you. You are always on my mind, and I can't help but smile whenever I see you.</p>
    <p>Life feels so much brighter when you're around, and I find myself longing to spend more time with you. Your laughter and the way you light up a room make my heart skip a beat.</p>
    <p>Janine, would you do me the honor of being more than just friends? I can't imagine a future without you in it, and I would be overjoyed if you felt the same way.</p>
    <p>Please let me know your thoughts, and I hope this confession doesn't affect our friendship negatively. You mean the world to me.</p>
    <p>With all my love,</p>
    <p>Kent</p>
